[h1]AntifreeZe — DayZ server FPS booster and AI performance optimizer[/h1]

[b]Up to +400% FPS in heavy zombie load scenarios![/b]
AntifreeZe is a pure server-side DayZ mod designed to improve server performance and reduce CPU load when zombies cannot reach the player behind walls, windows, or on elevated positions.
Real benchmarks show [b]4–6x performance gain[/b] in scenes with hundreds of active infected.
Ideal for high-pop servers, PvE events, or large-scale horde gameplay.

[b]How it works[/b]
[list]
[*]Optimizes infected AI logic (ZombieBase).

[*]Culls extra AI in dense local clusters.
[*]Keeps nearby zombies fully vanilla and responsive.
[*]No client installation required — server-side only.

[b]Performance and optimization[/b]
AntifreeZe significantly reduces CPU usage and stabilizes FPS under heavy AI load.
Useful for:
[list]
[*]Massive PvE events.
[*]Crowded towns and player hubs.
[*]Horde-style or infected-rich zones.
[*]Servers with increased AI spawn counts.
[/list]
The mod intelligently pauses AI that cannot reach players, avoiding wasted CPU cycles and preventing server frame drops.

[b]Experimental notice[/b]
Developed as part of issue [url=https://feedback.bistudio.com/T195642]T195642[/url].
This is an experimental optimization layer — it may change the default zombie behavior, but provides a real and measurable performance boost.
It does not modify damage, loot, or spawn systems.
